Software Development model: The Agile Model would be the best process model to use for a snake game project. This is because the Agile model allows for continuous feedback and adaptation to changing requirements, which is important for a game development project where user feedback is crucial. Additionally, the incremental delivery of working software allows for regular testing and integration, which can help ensure the quality of the final product.
