Requirements Specification for Snake Game
Purpose
The purpose of this document is to define the requirements for the development of a snake game.

Scope
The scope of the project includes the development of a classic snake game,
in which the player controls a snake that grows as it consumes food while avoiding collision with walls or its own tail.
The game will be developed using Pygame framework, with Python 3 as the programming language.

Functional Requirements:

1. The game should have a main menu that allows the player to start a new game, view the high scores, or exit the game.
2. The game should display the current score and the length of the snake on the game screen.
3. The snake should move continuously in a straight line until the player directs it to turn left or right.
4. The game should have a randomly generated food item that the snake can consume to grow longer.
5. The snake should die if it collides with a wall or its own tail.
6. The game should keep track of the highest scores achieved and display them on the high scores menu.
7. The game should have sound effects for game events such as snake movement, food consumption, and death.

Non-Functional Requirements
1.The game should have responsive and intuitive controls that allow the player to easily direct the snake's movements.
2. The game should have a visually appealing user interface that is easy to understand.
3. The game should be compatible with multiple operating systems and screen sizes.
4. The game should have a fast and smooth performance, with no lag or stuttering during gameplay.

Constraints
1. The game must be developed using Pygame framework, with Python 3 as the programming language.
2. The game should be developed to run on Windows and MacOS operating systems.

Assumptions
1. The player is familiar with classic snake game mechanics.
2. The player has a basic understanding of how to use a keyboard to control the snake.

Deliverables
1. Completed source code for the game.
2. User manual for the game.
3. Test plan and results.
4. High score data file.
